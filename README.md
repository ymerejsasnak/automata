# automata

* 1 dimensional cellular automata (JS)
* yeah this is just another mess/toy mostly for myself
* definite contol buttons to add: run automata, randomize, all black, all white, clear/start over
* possible control buttons: step thru, percentage random (ie 25% white), pattern repeat (ie define black black white and it repeats in parent row)
* will need to add function to delete all the divs so it can be run again and again...
* will need to disable parent row at appropriate times
